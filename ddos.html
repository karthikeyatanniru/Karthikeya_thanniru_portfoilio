    <div>
        <p class="description">
            <b>*Experience Duration:</b>
    
             One year of hands-on experience in planning, implementing, and refining DDoS mitigation measures.
        </p>

    </div>
  
    <div>
        <p class="description">
            <b>* Key Responsibilities: </b>
    
           

            Conduct Risk Assessment: Evaluate the organization's network architecture, applications, and vulnerabilities to identify potential DDoS attack vectors.
            Design DDoS Mitigation Plan: Develop a comprehensive DDoS mitigation plan tailored to the organization's specific needs and risk profile.
            Select DDoS Mitigation Solutions: Research and select appropriate DDoS mitigation tools and services, considering factors like scalability, performance, and cost-effectiveness.
            Implement DDoS Defenses: Configure and deploy DDoS mitigation solutions, including firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDPS), and DDoS protection services.
            Monitor Network Traffic: Continuously monitor network traffic patterns and anomalies to detect and mitigate potential DDoS attacks in real-time.
            Incident Response: Develop and implement incident response procedures to quickly respond to and mitigate DDoS attacks, minimizing service downtime and impact.
            Performance Optimization: Fine-tune DDoS mitigation solutions to optimize performance and minimize false positives/negatives, ensuring effective defense against DDoS attacks.
            Collaborate with Stakeholders: Work closely with IT teams, network administrators, and third-party vendors to coordinate DDoS mitigation efforts and share threat intelligence.
            Documentation and Reporting: Maintain detailed documentation of DDoS mitigation strategies, incident response procedures, and post-incident analysis reports for compliance and future reference.
            Training and Awareness: Conduct training sessions and awareness programs for staff members to educate them about DDoS threats, mitigation techniques, and best practices.
        </p>
